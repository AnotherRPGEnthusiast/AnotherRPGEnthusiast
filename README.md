I'm just a guy who likes RPGs.

I made Another RPG Engine, an engine for making text-based RPGs with complex battle mechanics in Twine. If that interests you, I teach a class on game design for grades 4-12 at S.E.T. School of Metrowest.

I am more active on <a href="https://anotherrpgenthusiast.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io</a>, where I host my projects. See there for more information about me.
